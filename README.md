This was the final project of Artificial Intelligence course, I aimed to analyze and compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms and neural network models on the CIFAR-10 dataset,
which consists of 60,000 color images in 10 different classes. The goal is to preprocess the data, design and implement models, optimize their performance, and evaluate the results using appropriate metrics.

Consisting:
1. Preprocessing: Normalization, data splitting, and data augmentation.
2. Modeling: Implementation of machine learning algorithms( Random Forest, SVM, KNN), Neural networks with varying architectures (3, 5, 10 layers)
3. Optimization: Use of different optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSprop) and hyperparameter tuning.
4. Evaluation: Comparison of models using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
